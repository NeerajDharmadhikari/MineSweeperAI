 * It took me 3-4 hours to finish the AI code for this lab. It was an overall fun lab and I enjoyed figuring out how to code the computer
 * to do the thinking and play the game for me. My AI has a random function, which picks randomly from remaining tiles and I wonder what
 * methods I can implement to improve the chances of my AI winning. I would rate this lab 4/5 difficulty and 5/5 fun and entertaining.
