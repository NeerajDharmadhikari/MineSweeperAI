			HOW TO PLAY:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Objective: The goal of the game is to reveal every tile in the panel that does not have a mine underneath it. <br> If you land on a mine, game over. You lose. If you successfully manage to avoid all mines and reveal all other tiles, then game over. You win.</li>
			<li>
				Number Tiles; When playing, you may reveal tiles with numbers underneath them. These numbers serve as clues to the <br> user by telling him or her how many mines are in the tiles around. For example, if you reveal a tile that had the number 2 in it, <br> that would mean that although that tile doesn&#39;t have any mine underneath it, there are 2 tiles around that box that do have mines underneath them. Any two of the <br> surrounding eight tiles could have a mine in them. Revealing these clues and using them strategically will help you reveal all tiles except for the ones with mines under them.</li>
			<li>
				Open Tiles: If you click on a tile that has nothing underneath it, it will cause a chain reaction and reveal all tiles <br> connected to it that are either numbers or open. It won&#39;t reveal any mines, don&#39;t worry! :)</li>
			<li>
				Flags: If you are certain that a tile is a mine, or if you are guessing that there is a mine underneath a tile, you can <br> flag the tile as a placeholder. Now that you have a flag, you can come back to it after solving the revealing rest of the <br> characters and remember that you think the tile underneath the flag holds a mine. Use these to organize and remember your progress.</li>
			<li>
				Lets hope you can navigate through this panel without landing on an mines! If you do get stuck, just hit spacebar! The computer will help you out. Who says machines don't have brains? Try to solve it in as little time as possible.</li>
